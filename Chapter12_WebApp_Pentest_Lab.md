# Web Application Pentesting Lab Instructions

This guide walks you through safe, hands-on web application pentesting using **OWASP Juice Shop** and your **Kali Linux VM**.

---

## Step 1: Access OWASP Juice Shop

1. Start your **Kali Linux VM** (from Chapter 10 setup).
2. Open a web browser inside Kali.
3. Navigate to [https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com).

---

## Step 2: Test for SQL Injection

1. On the **Login page**, enter the following into the **Email** field:  
   ```
   ' OR '1'='1
   ```  
2. Enter anything as the password.  
3. Click **Log in** and observe if it bypasses authentication.

---

## Step 3: Test for Broken Authentication

1. Return to the **Login page**.  
2. Try these credential combinations:  
   - `admin@juice-sh.op` / `admin123`  
   - `admin@juice-sh.op` / `123456`  
   - `admin@juice-sh.op` / `admin`  
3. If login succeeds, you’ve found weak/default credentials.

---

## Step 4: Test for Broken Access Control

1. Log in as a **normal user** (create a new account if needed).  
2. Manually visit:  
   ```
   https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#/administration
   ```  
3. If you can view the admin panel, access control is broken.  
4. Use **Developer Tools → Network tab** to look for user IDs and try changing them to view other users’ data.

---

## Step 5: Test for Security Misconfiguration

1. Browse the site normally, then try error triggers:  
   - Search for:  
     ```
     /../../etc/passwd
     ```  
   - Submit forms with strange or missing data.  
2. Check responses in **Developer Tools → Network tab**.  
3. Try visiting hidden pages:  
   - [https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/ftp](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/ftp)  
   - [https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/server.js](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/server.js)  

---

## Step 6: Test for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

1. In the **search bar**, enter:  
   ```
   <script>alert('Hello from XSS!')</script>
   ```  
2. Press Enter and see if a popup appears.  
3. In **Customer Feedback**, submit:  
   ```
   <script>alert('Stored XSS success!')</script>
   ```  
4. Reload the page to check if the script persists.

---

## Step 7: Explore Insecure Deserialization

1. Add items to your shopping cart.  
2. Open **Developer Tools → Application tab**.  
3. Inspect **Local Storage / Session Storage / Cookies** for values you can modify.  
4. Look for role changes (e.g., `"user":"standard"` → `"user":"admin"`).

---

## Step 8: Look for Outdated Components

1. In **Developer Tools → Network tab**, refresh the page.  
2. Look for libraries such as **jQuery**, **AngularJS**, or **Bootstrap**.  
3. Note their version numbers and search online for known vulnerabilities.

---

## Step 9: Observe Missing Logging & Monitoring

1. Attempt multiple failed logins.  
2. Try accessing admin pages repeatedly.  
3. Notice that there are **no alerts, lockouts, or warnings**.  
   - In real systems, this would be a critical issue.

---

## Step 10: Responsible Testing

- Only test on **legal, safe targets** like Juice Shop.  
- To continue learning, try:
